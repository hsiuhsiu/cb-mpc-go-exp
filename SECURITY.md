# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email cb-mpc@coinbase.com with a description of the potential issue, the affected versions or commits, and any relevant reproduction steps or proof-of-concept material. Our security team monitors this alias and will coordinate a fix or follow-up questions as needed.

We do **not** track security reports or pay bounties through GitHub issues or pull requests. Opening an issue for a suspected vulnerability will be closed without bounty eligibility.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and remediate before any public disclosure. We will keep you updated on the status of your report and credit you in release notes whenever appropriate.
