# PVE (Publicly Verifiable Encryption) Example

This example demonstrates how to use Publicly Verifiable Encryption (PVE) with a production-grade RSA KEM.

## What is PVE?

PVE (Publicly Verifiable Encryption) allows:
- **Encryption**: Encrypt a secret value with a public key
- **Public Verification**: Anyone can verify the ciphertext is correctly formed (without decrypting)
- **Decryption**: Only the holder of the private key can decrypt

This is useful for protocols where you need to prove that an encryption was performed correctly without revealing the plaintext.

## Features Demonstrated

This example shows:

1. **PVE Encryption** - Encrypting a secret scalar value
2. **PVE Verification** - Verifying the ciphertext is correct (publicly verifiable proof)
3. **Verification Failure Detection** - Detecting tampered ciphertexts or wrong parameters
4. **PVE Decryption** - Recovering the original value
5. **Decryption Failure Detection** - Detecting wrong ciphertexts or parameters
6. **Production-Grade Security** - Using 3072-bit RSA KEM (recommended for long-term security)

## Running the Example

```bash
# From repository root
go run examples/pve/main.go
```

## Expected Output

## Security Considerations

### RSA Key Size

This example uses 3072-bit RSA keys for long-term security:
- **2048 bits**: Minimum for current use (acceptable until ~2030)
- **3072 bits**: Recommended for long-term security (secure beyond 2030)
- **4096 bits**: High security applications

### Memory Security

The example demonstrates proper cleanup:
- Private keys are zeroized after use
- Sensitive scalar values are zeroized
- Use `cbmpc.ZeroizeBytes()` to clear sensitive data

### Deterministic Encryption

PVE uses deterministic encryption (same plaintext + key = same ciphertext).
This is required for public verifiability but means:
- Don't encrypt the same value multiple times with the same key/label
- Use unique labels for different encryption contexts

## Integration with Custom KEMs

You can integrate PVE with any KEM implementation, including:
- Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
- ML-KEM (post-quantum)
- Custom KEM schemes

See `pkg/cbmpc/internal/testkem/hsm_kem.go` for an HSM integration example.
